			<h1>My Cool Webpage</h1>
			<p>Im learning to be a web developer! How excititng! Im coding in my terminal right now, and though its less helpful than an IDE, it's prettier haha. And, I feel like a hacker. I dont even want to go to sleep tonight, I just want to progress through my course work. But, I have a meeting in the morning, and I have to be on camera and probably even speak. I want to dink some tea and do my hygiene first. Anyway, here's an image for this website.</p>
